# A feature-integration theory of attention

## Treisman & Gelade, 1980

## Main position of the theory: Attention must be directed serially to each stimulus if its distinction requires a conjunction of features, rather than one separable feature.

* Features come in early and automatically in parallel (across the scene) —> objects
  are identified later, separately, requiring attention
* "Integral features" are combined automatically, but separable features are not

**Goal:** use multiple methodologies that can address different questions/predictions
to strengthen the theory more than individual studies would.

## Paradigms

### 1. Visual search

Find the \_\_\_\_

#### Utility

* Define targets by either separate features or a conjunction of features
* Test whether search is serial vs. parallel by varying the number of distractors
  in the field & measuring slowdown

### 2. Texture segregation

#### Utility

* If figure-ground grouping is pre-attentive and parallel, then it should only
  be influenced by groups that differ in separate features, not conjunctions

### 3. Illusory conjunctions

Prevent attention —> do people make conjunctions that weren't present?

#### Utility

* Illusory conjs suggest that the features are "free floating" without directed attn
* i.e., you know a bunch of features were there, but not how they were combined

### 4. Identity and location

Prevent attn —> identify or locate a feature

#### Utility

* Should be able to identify an individual feature before locating it
* But need to locate a conjunction of features before identifying it

### 5. Interference from unattended stimuli

#### Utility

* Interference should be from individual features if they were not attended to
    * Conjunctions can't be accessed, so wouldn't interfere

(more on paper)

## So Basically,

* Detecting a conjunction of features requires attention and a serial and self-terminating search.
* Detecting separable features does not require attention and happens in parallel.
    * Texture segregation is pre-attentive if the distinction is on a separable feature.
* Conjunction searches vary in difficulty (it's not just attention on or off).
* Unidimensional distinctions can induce attention if the difference is not obvious.
* Local features within letters are separable rather than being "unitized" (usually).
* Identifying a conjunction of features depends on locating the item; identifying
    a separate feature does not.
