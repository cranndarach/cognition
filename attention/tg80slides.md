## Is texture segregation pre-attentive?

### Experiment 5

* Red and blue Os and Vs
* Grouped so that the boundaries separated red from blue (feature: color),
  O from V (feature: shape), or red O and blue V from red V and blue O (conjunction)
* Card sorting task: separate packs of cards into piles based on whether the
  boundary is vertical or horizontal
* **Significantly slower at sorting conjunctive pack** than the feature packs.

Suggests that texture segregation is **pre-attentive** if distinguishable on a
single separable feature.
