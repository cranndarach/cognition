title: "A feature-integration theory of attention — part 2"

## Is texture segregation pre-attentive?

### Experiment 5

* Red and blue Os and Vs
* Grouped so that the boundaries separated red from blue (feature: color),
  O from V (feature: shape), or red O and blue V from red V and blue O (conjunction)
* Card sorting task: separate packs of cards into piles based on whether the
  boundary is vertical or horizontal
* **Significantly slower at sorting conjunctive pack** than the feature packs.

### Experiment 7: This also applies to letters

* Groups of letters that either differed by the presence or absence of a diagonal
line (PO/RQ — feature) or by no simple feature (FK/EX — conjunction)
* Significantly faster to identify the border for the feature distinction compared
to the conjunction

Suggests that texture segregation is **pre-attentive** if distinguishable on a
single separable feature.

Also suggests that letters can be broken into features.

## The difficulty is graded.

### Experiment 6

* Same as Exp 5 except the shapes in the conjunctive condition were similar to
  half in the other condition on one dimension, and different on another
    * Red O and green $\Pi$ vs. blue O and green V
* This conjunctive condition was significantly slower than the feature conditions,
  but faster than Exp 5's conjunctive condition.

## Without attention, are features free-floating?

### Experiments 8 and 9

* If detecting a feature does not require attention, then it shouldn't depend on
knowing where it was.
* If feature integration requires attention, then identifying a conjunction *should*
depend on knowing where it was.
    * Detecting two or more features and then recognizing that they happen together

* Presented two rows of characters for a short amount of time
* Participants tried to name the "odd one out" and say where it was
    * Typical feature vs. conjunction manipulation

Accuracy at identifying the target was more closely related to accuracy at
locating it for the conjunction targets compared to the feature targets.

## Summary

* Detecting a conjunction of features requires attention and a serial and self-terminating search.
* Detecting separable features does not require attention and happens in parallel.
    * Texture segregation is pre-attentive if the distinction is on a separable feature.
* Conjunction searches vary in difficulty (it's not just attention on or off).
* Unidimensional distinctions can induce attention if the difference is not obvious.
* Local features within letters are separable rather than being "unitized."
* Identifying a conjunction of features depends on locating the item; identifying
    a separate feature does not.
