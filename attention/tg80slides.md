title: "A feature-integration theory of attention — part 2"

## Is texture segregation pre-attentive?

### Experiment 5

* Red and blue Os and Vs
* Grouped so that the boundaries separated red from blue (feature: color),
  O from V (feature: shape), or red O and blue V from red V and blue O (conjunction)
* Card sorting task: separate packs of cards into piles based on whether the
  boundary is vertical or horizontal
* **Significantly slower at sorting conjunctive pack** than the feature packs.

Suggests that texture segregation is **pre-attentive** if distinguishable on a
single separable feature.

Otherwise, it requires attention.

## The difficulty can be increased by 

### Experiment 6

* Same as Exp 5 except the shapes in the conjunctive condition were similar to
  half in the other condition on one dimension, and different on another
  * Red O and green Π vs. blue O and green V
