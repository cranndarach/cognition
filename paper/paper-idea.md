# Ideas for the paper

##  Distributed vs. modular approaches to cognitive modeling

* Seen as contrasting, but how much do they overlap?
* Are the approaches mutually exclusive, or can a model be somewhere in the
  middle?

## Analogy to OOP vs. FP

* Where do you draw the boundary between OO and FP styles?
  * Some languages are clearly one
    * e.g., Haskell is definitely functional and not OO
  * Some are a bit of both
    * e.g., everything in Python is an object, and you can do "normal"
    object-oriented programming, but it also has lambdas, list comprehensions,
    generators, itertools, etc.
* How do you define things like modularity?
  * Objects seem like classic modules in that they have a contained set of
  properties and methods, esp in languages with public/private disctinctions
  * OTOH, "pure" functional programming is considered modular because the
  calculations do not have consequencesâ€”you cannot reassign/update a value,
  so nothing really affects anything else
* Does the object-oriented/functional distinction relate to the distributed/
modular question?
* Is one more analogous to distributed and the other more analogous to modular
models?
* Is one more analogous to cognition in general? (That's a bit of a big
question.)
